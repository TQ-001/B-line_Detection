# B-line Detection
This Repository includes unsupervised feature extraction (DetCo), model convert, and fine-tuning. 

**Pre-train** 

Please refer to [DetCo.pytorch](https://github.com/shuuchen/DetCo.pytorch)


**Model convert**

This file converts the format of the pre-trained weight file to the format that can be used in fine-tuning.


**Fine-tuning**

Please refer to [DetCo](https://github.com/xieenze/DetCo)
